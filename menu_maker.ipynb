    "\n",
    "Upgrades could include uploading current weight, goal weight and date, and automatically calculating calories per day. Switching any item in the menu for another one that meets the requirements. A recommender system that sees which recipes you normally like (you can rate them) and suggests similar ones. A slider bar that adjusts what fraction of your suggested meals are similar to others and which ones are new suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, when a user initiates their account, they enter current weight, goal weight, goal date, nutritional needs, and rate with stars a few representative meals so that we get an idea of what sort of recipes they prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, if this were to work with epicure or something like that, it would generate an automatic shopping list with links to their products.\n",

Also, it should remember what I have eaten in the past so I can see insights and maybe it can learn to suggest things I like."
